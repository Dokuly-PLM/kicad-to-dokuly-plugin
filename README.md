## Features

- Generate Gerber and Drill files from your KiCad PCB design.
- Export Schematic PDFs.
- Generate and upload BOM CSV files.
- Generate position files for SMD components.
- Upload files directly to Dokuly with a single click.

## Prerequisites

- **KiCad 8.0 or later** installed on your system.
- **Python 3** (comes bundled with KiCad).
- A **Dokuly account** with appropriate permissions.
- **Dokuly API Key** obtained from your Dokuly tenant.

## Installation

1. **Manual Installation via ZIP File:**

   - Download the latest version of the plugin as a ZIP file:
     [Download v1.0.0](https://github.com/Dokuly-PLM/kicad-to-dokuly-plugin/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.zip)
   - Extract the ZIP file contents to your KiCad plugins directory:

     - **Windows:** `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Documents\KiCad\8.0\scripting\plugins\`
     - **macOS:** `/Users/<YourUsername>/Documents/KiCad/8.0/scripting/plugins/`
     - **Linux:** `/home/<YourUsername>/Documents/KiCad/8.0/scripting/plugins/`
    
     - **NOTE**: After extracting, rename the folder from `kicad-to-dokuly-plugin-1.0.0` to `kicad-to-dokuly-plugin` to avoid issues with KiCadâ€™s plugin directory structure.

2. **Manual Installation via Git:**

   - Alternatively, clone the repository directly into the plugins directory:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Dokuly-PLM/kicad-to-dokuly-plugin.git <YourPluginDirectory>
     ```
   - Ensure the `<YourPluginDirectory>` matches the path of your KiCad plugins directory (as listed above).

3. **Verify Installation:**

   - After installation, you should see the Dokuly cloud icon in the KiCad toolbar.


## Configuration

Before using the plugin, you need to configure it by setting up a `.env` file and providing necessary details.

### 1. Locate the Plugin Folder

- **Windows:** `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Documents\KiCad\8.0\scripting\plugins\kicad-to-dokuly-plugin`
- **macOS:** `/Users/<YourUsername>/Documents/KiCad/8.0/scripting/plugins/kicad-to-dokuly-plugin`
- **Linux:** `/home/<YourUsername>/Documents/KiCad/8.0/scripting/plugins/kicad-to-dokuly-plugin`

### 2. Create or Edit the `.env` File

In the `kicad-to-dokuly-plugin` folder, create a new file named `.env` (if it doesn't exist) and open it in a text editor.

#### Sample `.env` File for Windows

```ini
DOKULY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DOKULY_TENANT=your_tenant_name
DOKULY_URL=dokuly.com
URL_PROTOCOL=https
REPLACE_FILES=true
THEME_PATH=C:\Path\To\Your\Theme\someTemplate.json
DRAWING_SHEET_PATH=C:\Path\To\Your\DrawingSheet\someDrawingSheet.kicad_wks
```

**Note**: The same example works fine for Linux and MacOS, the only change necessary is to update the absolute paths for **THEME_PATH** and **DRAWING_SHEET_PATH**.

## Explanation of Configuration Variables

- **DOKULY_API_KEY:** Your Dokuly API Key obtained from the Dokuly admin page.
- **DOKULY_TENANT:** Your Dokuly tenant name (e.g., `tenant` for `tenant.dokuly.com`).
- **DOKULY_URL:** The Dokuly server URL. Use `dokuly.com` for the cloud-hosted version or your own domain if self-hosted.
- **URL_PROTOCOL:** Protocol to use (`http` or `https`). Use `https` for secure connections. Use `http` if self-hosted on local network.
- **REPLACE_FILES:** If true, the files on the PCBA will be overwritten with the new files. If false, files will not be overwritten.  
**Note**: We recommend having **REPLACE_FILES** set to true.
- **THEME_PATH:** Path to your KiCad theme file (e.g., `Theme.json`).
- **DRAWING_SHEET_PATH:** Path to your KiCad drawing sheet template file (e.g., `Sheet_Template.kicad_wks`).

**Note:**: The theme path and the drawing sheet path must be full paths. E.g. `C:\Users\SomeUser\kicad-libraries\Theme.json`.

### 3. Obtain Your Dokuly API Key

1. **Log in to Dokuly:**
    - Navigate to your Dokuly tenant URL (e.g., `https://your_tenant_name.dokuly.com`).
    - If using self-hosted or running on localhost, use your custom url.

2. **Access the Admin Page:**
    - Click on the **Administration** tab in the navigation menu.

3. **Navigate to API Keys:**
    - In the admin panel, go to the **API Keys** section.

4. **Create or Retrieve API Key:**
    - If you don't have an API key, create a new one.
    - Make sure it has access to the project that the PCBA is connected to.
    - Copy the API key.

5. **Update `.env` File:**
    - Replace `your_api_key_here` in your `.env` file with the API key you just copied.

### 4. Set Up URL Configuration

Depending on your Dokuly deployment, configure the following in your `.env` file:

- **For Dokuly Cloud Hosting:**

    ```ini
    DOKULY_URL=dokuly.com
    URL_PROTOCOL=https
    ```

- **For Local Testing or Self-Hosting:**

    ```ini
    DOKULY_URL=localhost:8000
    URL_PROTOCOL=http
    ```

    *(Adjust the port number if your local server runs on a different port.)*

- **For Custom Domain Hosting:**

    ```ini
    DOKULY_URL=yourdomain.com
    URL_PROTOCOL=https
    ```

### 5. Include Theme and Drawing Sheet Paths

Provide the paths to your KiCad theme and drawing sheet template files.

- **THEME_PATH:**
    - Path to your theme file (e.g., `theme.json`).

- **DRAWING_SHEET_PATH:**
    - Path to your drawing sheet template file (e.g., `sheet.kicad_wks`).

**Example Paths on Windows:**

```ini
THEME_PATH=C:\Users\YourUsername\nd-kicad-libraries\theme.json
DRAWING_SHEET_PATH=C:\Users\YourUsername\nd-kicad-libraries\sheet.kicad_wks
```

**Note:** Ensure that the paths are absolute and correctly point to the files on your system.

## Usage

### 1. Open Your PCB Project

Open the KiCad project containing your PCB design.

### 2. Ensure Board Variables are Set

The plugin relies on specific board variables to identify the PCBA and revision.

#### Setting Board Variables

- **Open PCB Editor:**
  - Open your PCB design in KiCad's PCB Editor.

- **Access Board Setup:**
  - Go to `File > Board Setup` or press `E` while hovering over the board.

- **Set Board Variables:**
  - Navigate to the **Text Variables** section.
  - Add the following variables:
    - **PCBA_NUMBER**: Set this to your PCBA number (e.g., `PCBA1234`, **Note**: This must be the dokuly PCBA number).
    - **PART_REVISION**: Set this to your revision identifier (e.g., `A`, **Note**: This must be the dokuly PCBA revision).

- **Save Changes:**
  - Click **OK** to save the board variables.

### 3. Use the Plugin

- **Launch the Plugin:**
  - In KiCad's PCB Editor, click on the **Dokuly Cloud** icon in the toolbar.

- **Verify PCBA Information:**
  - The plugin window will display the **PCBA_NUMBER** and **REVISION** extracted from your board variables.

- **Fetch PCBA from Dokuly:**
  - The plugin will attempt to fetch the PCBA item from Dokuly using the provided PCBA number and revision.
  - Check the output area in the plugin window for messages confirming the fetch operation.

- **Push PCBA to Dokuly:**
  - Click the **Push PCBA to Dokuly** button.
  - The plugin will:
    - Generate PCB PDFs for front and back.
    - Generate Gerber and Drill files.
    - Generate the Schematic PDF.
    - Generate the BOM CSV.
    - Generate Position files for SMD components.
    - Upload all generated files to Dokuly.
  - Monitor the output area for progress and any error messages.
  
    **WARNING**: While the upload and file generation is being processed, please do not click the **Push PCBA to Dokuly** button or close the plugin window.

- **Verify in Dokuly:**
  - Log in to your Dokuly account.
  - Navigate to the PCBA item to verify that the files have been uploaded and associated correctly.

## Troubleshooting

- **Plugin Not Appearing in Toolbar:**
  - Ensure that the plugin is installed in the correct directory.
  - Restart KiCad after installation.

- **Unable to Fetch PCBA:**
  - Verify that your `.env` file is correctly configured.
  - Ensure that the `PCBA_NUMBER` and `PART_REVISION` board variables are set.
  - Check your internet connection and API key validity.

- **File Generation Errors:**
  - Ensure that KiCad is installed correctly and that `kicad-cli` is accessible.
  - Verify the paths to the theme and drawing sheet files.

- **File Upload Failures:**
  - Check the output area for specific error messages.
  - Ensure that your Dokuly API key has the necessary permissions.

- **File Deletion Errors:**

### Additional Tips

- **Updating the `.env` File:**
  - Ensure there are no trailing spaces or hidden characters in your `.env` file.
  - Use absolute paths for `THEME_PATH` and `DRAWING_SHEET_PATH` to avoid issues.

- **Permissions:**
  - Make sure that the `.env` file and the plugin folder have the appropriate read/write permissions.

- **KiCad Variables:**
  - Double-check that `PCBA_NUMBER` and `PART_REVISION` are correctly set in your KiCad board variables. These are crucial for the plugin to function properly.

- **Testing:**
  - After setting up, perform a test upload with a sample PCB to ensure that all configurations are correct and the upload process works as expected.
